You can use Lava's direct deposit feature to get paid directly to Lava from your paycheck.

On the home screen, click on "**Add Dollars**" below the "**Dollars**" tab.

Select "**Choose Adding Option**" and then select "**Direct Deposit**."

From there, you'll see the information for your virtual dollar bank account. Direct your payroll to that virtual account, and your full paycheck amount will be added to your dollar balance in Lava.
