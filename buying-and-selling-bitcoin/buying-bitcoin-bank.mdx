You can use Lava's virtual bitcoin bank account feature to purchase bitcoin via bank transfer.

Start by clicking the "**Bitcoin**" tab on the home screen. Scroll down to "**Buy**," and then click "**Transfer from Bank**."

The next screen will show you the details for your virtual bitcoin bank account. You can use these details to send a payment from your personal bank, and the funds will be auto-converted to BTC and added to your bitcoin balance on Lava upon receipt.
