title: "Making Loan Payments "
---

You can make payments on your loan directly within Lava. 

Start by navigating to the "**Loans**" tab on the home screen, then click through to the individual loan for which you'd like to make a payment. 

Click “**Make a Payment**,” select your payment amount, and confirm.

You can make your monthly payment, repay the entire loan, or choose a specific amount to pay in order to manage your loan. On Lava, there are no penalties for early loan repayment. 

Your payments will always cover the accrued monthly interest first, with any remaining funds applies towards reducing the principal balance.
