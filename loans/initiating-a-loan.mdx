Start by clicking “Initiate Loan” on the home screen. 

Enter the amount you’d like to borrow in dollars. Select your loan duration (up to one year), and your loan terms will auto-populate based on your borrow amount and loan duration.

Click “Continue,” and you’ll see a detailed breakdown of your loan terms. Tap the green info icons next to “Liquidation Price” and “Monthly Payment” to learn more about collateral ratios, how monthly payments are calculated, and when monthly payments are due.

Once you have reviewed the terms, click “Initiate Loan,” and you’ll receive your loan capital immediately. Your funds will be added to your dollar balance on Lava and will be instantly available to spend or withdraw.
