Lava offers the option to extend your loan, but only before the loan due date. 

To extend your loan, click “**Extend**” in the top right corner of the loan information page. You’ll see the terms of your loan extension, including the extension fee and any changes in the interest rate. 

Once you’ve reviewed the terms, click “**Extend Loan**” to confirm.
